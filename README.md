First of all we extracted tweets from twitter through snscraper. After collecting dataset, we perform analysis on data in different ways.
I perform analysis in certain steps:
 1. Extracting tweets.
 2. Converting text into lowercase
 3. Removing links
 4. Removing hastags
 5. Removing punctuations
 6. Separating data for analysis
 7. Removing stop words.
 8. Match the emotions
 9. Counting emotion values
 10. Build the chart.
